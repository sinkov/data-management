# Github Commits Database Design & Analysis 
For the final course project (fcp), you will handle a real-world dataset.  In particular, you are required to store, manipulate, and analyze GitHub data for PyTorch and Tensorflow. Both projects are examples of open source software (OSS) development. OSS challenges common managerial assumptions on the organizing and func- tioning of organizations (Gulati et al., 2012), attracting the interest of research enthusiasts from several disciplines (e.g., information systems, management, and sociology). But the OSS phenomenon is also extremely relevant from a business perspective. For example, you may think of the Python project or the father of all – Linux (powering NASA projects, Chrome OS, Android hardware, and the largest share of worldwide servers). The OSS experience keeps offering fresh business and research insights and may guide us in the next phase of the organizing technologies based on remote work.
# Tasks
 You are required to choose your preferred DBMS – PostgreSQL or MongoDB – and: 1.Clean, manipulate, and structure data. The expected result is a well- designed dataset that complies with the specific approach of the chosen DBMS. 2.Provide valuable descriptive insights.  The expected result is a set of descriptive statistics that depicts some interesting trends or noteworthy data characteristics. 3.Perform an insightful data analysis.  For example, you can analyse the modularity of the source code or the features of issues getting the community’s attention. You may want to skim through the reference list provided to get some inspiration. To perform tasks 1 and 2, you need to use eitherSQLorMQL(MongoDB query language). Alternatively, if you prefer using python, you can leveragepsycopg2 orpymongo. For what concerns task 3, you should usePySpark(e.g., you may want to leverage on the MLlib pyspark library).
